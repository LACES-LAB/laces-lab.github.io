I am a PhD student specializing in advanced multiscale coupling techniques for high-performance applications. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I obtained my MS in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where my research centered on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), with a specific focus on error estimation in finite volume methods. I have experience that extends to areas such as design optimization, numerical methods, and machine learning.
