For a better future of humanity with equal and sustainable energy for all, I believe in the potential of fusion energy. Accelerated Monte Carlo particle transport is on the cornerstone of plasma and fusion reactor simulations. Moreover, it will enable the radiation interaction with human body related technology to simulate dose in real-time.
