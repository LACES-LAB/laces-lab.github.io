  ## Now Hiring!

  I am currently hiring a highly motivated student to work on a
  DOE project to support coupling of Tokamak and Stellarator codes. 
  Advancements will be made in the [Parallel Coupler for Multimodel 
  Simulations]({{< relref "/projects/pcms" >}}) to improve capabilities for [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/) and [Aurora](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/high-performance-computing/supercomputing/exascale-computing.html). 


  I am additionally hiring a highly motivated student to work on 
  high-fidelity multiscale simulations of fibrous biological tissues
  using [MuMFiM]({{< relref "/projects/mumfim" >}}). 
  This student will develop new computational methodologies for GPUs and make use of [machine learning techniques]({{< relref "/projects/machine-learning-networks" >}}).


  Please [contact me](mailto:mersoj2@rpi.edu) if you are interested!
