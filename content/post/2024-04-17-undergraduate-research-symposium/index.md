Paul presented his poster "Finite Element Modeling of the Trans-sacral Vertical Shear Fracture in the Pelvis" at the undergraduate research symposium.

During the fall semester, Paul created a detailed finite element model of a vertical shear fracture in the pelvis. In the photo above, he's presenting his work and holding a 3D-printed version of the model that he developed. This 3D print helped Paul gain a better understanding of the anatomical structure.
