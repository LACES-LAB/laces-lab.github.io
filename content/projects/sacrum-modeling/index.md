This project is developing models of Vertical Shear Fracture
  in the Pelvis on patient specific geometry. It is a collaborative 
  effort with [Dr. Regis Renard](https://uamshealth.com/provider/regis-l-renard/) (UAMS),
  and [Dr. Brian Salazar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian10salazar/) (U.C. Berkeley).
