abstract: >
  The growing scale of high-performance computing systems increasingly enables scientists to
  develop more complex applications as in situ workflows composed of coupled simulation and
  analysis codes. It is therefore important that workflow programming systems and runtime
  middleware support the composition and execution of these complex applications intuitively
  and efficiently. The scientific computing community has put significant effort into
  purpose-built coupled simulation codes that have been optimized for specialized use cases.
  However, the development effort involving the coupling of established codes has been
  largely ad hoc. The Benesh programming system was recently proposed to support the
  development of coupled simulation workflows from existing code bases. Benesh allows a
  shared data model to be defined across established codes, so that they can be interfaced
  in a flexible, coupled workflow. In this paper, we develop Benesh into a workflow
  development framework. Using Benesh, we develop workflow data model and data exchange
  definitions for coupled, in situ workflows. We evaluate the cost of development using
  Benesh in terms of development time and overhead, showing that Benesh offers development
  advantages without undue impact upon workflow performance.
