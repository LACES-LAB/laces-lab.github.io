  In this article we discuss the effective properties of composites containing a crosslinked athermal fiber network embedded in a continuum elastic matrix, which are representative for a broad range of biological materials. The goal is to evaluate the accuracy of the widely used biomechanics parallel coupling model in which the tissue response is defined as the additive superposition of the network and matrix contributions, and the interaction of the two components is neglected. To this end, explicit, fully coupled models are used to evaluate the linear and non-linear response of the composite. It is observed that in the small strain, linear regime the parallel model leads to errors when the ratio of the individual stiffnesses of the two components is in the range 0.1â€“10, and the error increases as the matrix approaches the incompressible limit. The data presented can be used to correct the parallel model to improve the accuracy of the overall stiffness prediction. In the non-linear large deformation regime linear superposition does not apply. The data shows that the matrix reduces the stiffening rate of the network, and the response is softer than that predicted by the parallel model. The correction proposed for the linear regime mitigates to a large extent the error in the non-linear regime as well, provided the matrix Poisson ratio is not close to 0.5. The special case in which the matrix is rendered auxetic is also evaluated and it is seen that the auxeticity of the matrix may compensate the stiffening introduced by the network, leading to a composite with linear elastic response over a broad range of strains.
