  Thermal management of semiconductor devices is becoming more challenging with the
  progressing technology nodes. Implementation of advanced device platforms such as CFET and
  advanced chip architecture such as 3DVLSI, would result in thermal transport through the
  thin back-end-of-line (BEOL) layers. An accurate understanding of anisotropic heat
  transfer through multiple stacked layers of dielectrics and metal interconnects is
  therefore necessary, and is garnering some research interests. The thermal analysis can be
  conducted either through a heterogenized approach, using the individual properties of all
  the BEOL layers, or a homogenized approach, by assuming a single medium with effective
  thermal and geometric properties. This work investigates the temperature response of
  sandwiched BEOL layers with and without the effective medium approximation, using both a
  time dependent 2D analytical model and a steady state 2D multiscale FEM scheme. It is
  observed through the analytical study that the effective medium approximation is accurate
  at low frequency and at larger dimension of the heat source. Moreover, at larger heater
  widths and larger laser it is independent of the anisotropic thermal conductivities of the
  layer(s) at larger heater widths. Results from the multiscale FEM model are consistent
  showing an increase in homogenization error as heater size decreases.
