  This work reports the experimental measurements of cross-plane thermal conductivities of
  individual BEOL films, using 3ω technique with a central heater. Each thermal measurement
  requires two steps viz., the calibration of temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of
  the metallic thermistors followed by measurements of the AC temperature amplitude of the
  central heater as a function of the applied AC frequency. The collected thermal signals
  are then fitted against a 2D heat conduction model to determine the anisotropic thermal
  conductivities of the thin film. This work presents the effective cross-plane thermal
  conductivities of different thicknesses of isotropic silicon nitride (SiN) and tetraethyl
  orthosilicate (TEOS) samples and compares them with that reported in the literature.
  Moreover, this work presents an analytical sensitivity study to the in-plane thermal
  transport in both individual BEOL films and sandwiched layers of copper and BEOL
  dielectrics. In the analytical sensitivity study, the in-plane thermal conductivity of
  both individual dielectric film and metal layer sandwiched between two dielectric films,
  is changed by 10% and the corresponding percentage change in temperature amplitude is
  captured as a function of applied AC frequency, heater width, and cross-plane thermal
  conductivity of the dielectric film(s). Temperature amplitude sensitivity is shown to
  increase with increasing AC frequency, decreasing heater width, and decreasing cross-plane
  thermal conductivity of the dielectric layer for both single layer of dielectric film and
  sandwiched layers of metal and dielectric films. However, an understanding of both signal
  sensitivity and signal strength is required to position the in-plane thermistor optimally.
