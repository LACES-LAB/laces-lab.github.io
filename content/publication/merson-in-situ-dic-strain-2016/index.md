  A 60-mm diameter disk of 2024 aluminum was indented by opposing steel indenters over a
  central 10 mm region. Residual stress measurements made using neutron diffraction and the
  contour method matched each other, but not a finite element (FE) model with a calibrated
  model for plastic anisotropy of the aluminum. Since residual stresses are only the
  endpoint of the process, in situ data was needed to determine which portion of the
  load/unload process was causing model deficiencies. The indentation process was repeated
  on a new specimen with three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) to map full-
  field strain information and with resistance strain gauges to obtain high fidelity strain
  information at discrete locations. The DIC data was too noisy to extract strains, so
  displacements were analyzed after rigid body motion was removed. The deformation field
  revealed geometric imperfections of the indenters that were within tolerance, but had
  significant effect on the stress state. An updated FE model including geometric
  imperfections in the indenters gave better agreement with the DIC data. It did not however
  allow the material model to become the dominant effect and thus model calibration was
  unsuccessful.
