abstract: >
  model-traits is a C++ library for setting up scientific 
  models and computational analysis. It provides a minimal 
  API for applying boundary conditions (or other attributes) 
  to the geometry of a model. model-traits can either be used 
  directly as a library, or can be used to generate input files 
  for an existing analysis code. The library design is optimized 
  to make adding new input and output file formats easy and 
  maintainable without patching the core library.
