  Indentation is often used to measure the stiffness of soft materials whose main structural
  component is a network of filaments, such as the cellular cytoskeleton, connective tissue,
  gels, and the extracellular matrix. For elastic materials, the typical procedure requires
  fitting the experimental force-displacement curve with the Hertz model, which predicts
  that f=kδ1.5 and k is proportional to the reduced modulus of the indented material,
  E/(1−ν2). Here we show using explicit models of fiber networks that the Hertz model
  applies to indentation in network materials provided the indenter radius is larger than
  approximately 12lc, where lc is the mean segment length of the network. Using smaller
  indenters leads to a relation between force and indentation displacement of the form
  f=kδq, where q is observed to increase with decreasing indenter radius. Using the Hertz
  model to interpret results of indentations in network materials using small indenters
  leads to an inferred modulus smaller than the real modulus of the material. The origin of
  this departure from the classical Hertz model is investigated. A compacted, stiff network
  region develops under the indenter, effectively increasing the indenter size and modifying
  its shape. This modification is marginal when large indenters are used. However, when the
  indenter radius is small, the effect of the compacted layer is pronounced as it changes
  the indenter profile from spherical towards conical. This entails an increase of exponent
  q above the value of 1.5 corresponding to spherical indenters. Statement of significance
  The article presents a study of indentation in network biomaterials and demonstrates a
  size effect which precludes the use of the Hertz model to infer the elastic constants of
  the material. The size effect occurs once the indenter radius is smaller than
  approximately 12 times the mean segment length of the network. This result provides
  guidelines for the selection of indentation conditions that guarantee the applicability of
  the Hertz model. At the same time, the finding may be used to infer the mean segment
  length of the network based on indentations with indenters of various sizes. Hence, the
  method can be used to evaluate this structural parameter which is not easily accessible in
  experiments.
