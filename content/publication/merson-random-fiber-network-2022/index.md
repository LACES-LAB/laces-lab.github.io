  This article presents the displacement field produced by a point 
  force acting on an athermal random fiber network (the Green function 
  for the network). The problem is defined within the limits of linear
  elasticity, and the field is obtained numerically for nonaffine networks
  characterized by various parameter sets. The classical Green function
  solution applies at distances from the point force larger than a threshold
  which is independent of the network parameters in the range studied.
  At smaller distances, the nonlocal nature of fiber interactions modifies
  the solution.
