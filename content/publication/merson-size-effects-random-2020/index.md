  Materials with a stochastic ﬁber network as the main structural constituent are broadly
  encountered in engineering and in biology. These materials are characterized by multiscale
  heterogeneity and hence their properties evaluated numerically or experimentally are
  generally dependent on the size of the sample considered. In this work we evaluate the
  size effect on the linear and non-linear mechanical response of three-dimensional
  stochastic ﬁber networks and determine its dependence on material parameters and on the
  degree of afﬁnity of network deformation. The size effect is more pronounced in non-afﬁne
  networks than in afﬁne networks and decreases slowly when the model size increases. In
  order to eliminate this effect, models lager than can be effectively solved with current
  computers have to be considered. To address this issue, we propose a method that allows
  using relatively small models, while accurately predicting the small and large strain
  behaviors of the network. The method is based on the generalized boundary conditions
  introduced in (Glüge 2013, Computational Materials Science 79, 408–416), which are being
  adapted here to the requirements imposed by ﬁbrous materials.
