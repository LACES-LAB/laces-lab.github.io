abstract: >
  Regular composite materials are made from a small number of constituent phases, usually
  two, which are arranged spatially such to maximize the stiffness and strength of the
  material. In this article, we review results related to defining a new class of stochastic
  composite materials with large microstructural variability both in terms of the
  composition and spatial distribution of constituents. Further, new data on Green functions
  in stochastic continua is presented.
