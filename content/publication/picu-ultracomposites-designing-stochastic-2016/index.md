abstract: >
  Regular composite materials are made from a small number of constituent phases,
  usually two, which are arranged spatially such to maximize the stiffness and 
  strength of the material. In this article, we review results related to defining
  a new class of stochastic composite materials with large microstructural variability
  both in terms of the composition and spatial distribution of constituents. Further,
  new data on Green functions in stochastic continua is presented.
