  This work presents a novel sensitivity approach that quantifies sensitivity to regimes of
  a model’s state variables rather than constitutive model parameters. This Physical Regime
  Sensitivity (PRS) determines which regimes of a model’s independent variables have the
  biggest influence on an experiment or application. PRS analysis is demonstrated on a
  strength model used in the simulation of a copper Taylor cylinder. In a series of
  simulations, the strength model was perturbed sequentially in local regimes of plastic
  strain, plastic strain rate, temperature and pressure, and then the prediction of cylinder
  shape was compared to unperturbed calculations. Results show, for example, that the
  deformed length of the cylinder was most sensitive to strength at a strain rate of 1.0 ×
  104/sec., but the deformed footprint radius was most sensitive to strength at a strain
  rate of about 4.0 × 104/sec. Compared to current histogram approaches, PRS can be used to
  design or interpret integrated experiments by identifying not just which regimes are
  accessed somewhere in the experiment but the causality question of which regimes actually
  affect the measured data. PRS should allow one to focus experimental and modeling efforts
  where they are most needed and to better interpret experiments.
