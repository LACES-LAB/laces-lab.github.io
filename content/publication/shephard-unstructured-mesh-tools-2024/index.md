abstract: > 
  As fusion simulation codes increasingly account for the full geometric complexity of magnetically confined fusion systems, a need arose to provide tailored unstructured mesh technologies to address the specific needs of fusion plasma simulation codes and their coupling to other physics simulation codes. This paper presents a high level overview of a set of unstructured mesh developments that include; methods to effectively employ manufacturing CAD models in the construction of quality analysis model geometries, specialized mesh generation and adaptation tools; an infrastructure to support parallel particlein-cell calculation on unstructured meshes; and an infrastructure for coupling of massively parallel mesh-based fusion codes.
