  A 60-mm diameter disk of 2024 aluminum was indented by opposing steel 
  indenters over a central 10 mm region. Residual stress measurements made
  using neutron diffraction and the contour method matched each other, but
  not a finite element (FE) model with a calibrated model for plastic anisotropy
  of the aluminum. Since residual stresses are only the endpoint of the process,
  in situ data was needed to determine which portion of the load/unload process
  was causing model deficiencies. The indentation process was repeated on a new
  specimen with three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) to map
  full-field strain information and with resistance strain gauges to obtain
  high fidelity strain information at discrete locations. The DIC data was
  too noisy to extract strains, so displacements were analyzed after rigid 
  body motion was removed. The deformation field revealed geometric imperfections
  of the indenters that were within tolerance, but had significant effect on the
  stress state. An updated FE model including geometric imperfections in the
  indenters gave better agreement with the DIC data. It did not however allow
  the material model to become the dominant effect and thus model calibration
  was unsuccessful.
