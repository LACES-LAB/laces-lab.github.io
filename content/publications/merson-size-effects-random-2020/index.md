  Materials with a stochastic fiber network as the main structural 
  constituent are broadly encountered in engineering and in biology. 
  These materials are characterized by multiscale heterogeneity and hence 
  their properties evaluated numerically or experimentally are generally
  dependent on the size of the sample considered. In this work we evaluate
  the size effect on the linear and non-linear mechanical response of 
  three-dimensional stochastic fiber networks and determine its dependence
  on material parameters and on the degree of affinity of network deformation.
  The size effect is more pronounced in non-affine networks than in affine 
  networks and decreases slowly when the model size increases. In order to 
  eliminate this effect, models lager than can be effectively solved with 
  current computers have to be considered. To address this issue, we propose
  a method that allows using relatively small models, while accurately 
  predicting the small and large strain behaviors of the network. The method
  is based on the generalized boundary conditions introduced in (Glüge 2013, 
  Computational Materials Science 79, 408–416), which are being adapted here 
  to the requirements imposed by fibrous materials.
