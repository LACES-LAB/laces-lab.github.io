This studio/learning laboratory course introduces techniques of numerical computing as a problem-solving method. Problems are drawn from the basic sciences (e.g., physics and chemistry) and the engineering sciences (e.g., statics). The numerical methods will be implemented through computer programming as both a way of thinking (algorithms) and a language to translate mathematics into computer instructions. Precision and accuracy, complexity, modularity, dimensionality, and discrete versus stochastic methods are covered.
